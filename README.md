# Machine_Learning  # python 3.5  # tensorflow  
The place to store my toy models for ML. 
Most of these codes are constructed within the framework of Tensorflow.
For visualization, some additional packages are used. (such as pygame.) 


Notice : Some of these codes are not well organized and still under development.
==============================================================================================

Currently, this repository includes:


a. MNIST handwritten digit recognition project.  (3/9/2018  --  Still under development)
Abstract : 
Training your own neural network, saving and restoring the tf.data for later use.
Fully Connected Layer and Convolution Layer are implemented in this project.
A writing panel is built (use pygame), so users can interact with their own neural network directly.
